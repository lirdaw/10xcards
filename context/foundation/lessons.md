## Match branch names in CI/hooks to the repo's actual default (`main`)

- **Context**: CI/CD workflows and git-related config (`.github/workflows/*.yml`, husky hooks) — implement / review phase.
- **Problem**: The scaffolded `ci.yml` triggered only on `master`, but the repo's working branch is `main`, so CI silently never ran on any push or PR. Caught during M1L4 setup.
- **Rule**: When generating or reviewing CI/CD workflows, git hooks, or any branch-referencing config, confirm branch names match the repo's actual default branch. This project uses `main` — do not assume `master`.
- **Applies to**: implement, impl-review
